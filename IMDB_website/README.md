# IMDB website scraping

Web Scraping is the process of programmatically extracting some data from a website. In Python, we can easily write a program to scrape website by using the libraries. For this project i have written a python program which will access the IMDB website and then fetch the top rated movies present in the IMDB website and then load this data into an excel file.

The libraries used in this project is:
* BeautifulSoup: To parse the HTML content and then provides multiple methods which can be used to extract the data from any HTML tags.
* requests: To access the desired websites.
* openpyxl: To create a new excel file and then rename the sheet name and then load data into an excel file.

The python code is:
