# IMDB website scraping

I have written a python program which will access the IMDB website and then fetch the top rated movies present in the IMDB website and then load this data into an excel file.

### The libraries used in this project is:
* **BeautifulSoup:** To parse the HTML content and then provides multiple methods which can be used to extract the data from any HTML tags.
* **requests:** To access the desired websites.
* **openpyxl:** To create a new excel file and then rename the sheet name and then load data into an excel file.

### The python code is:
